<h2>Reverse RPS</h2>
<p>Reverse Rock Paper Scissors is a funny game.
    <br>The rule is super simple : Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock and Rock beats Scissors. You'll get one point for each correct response. Try to respond promptly, set a record and share it with your friends !

    <br>The game will challenge your brain's response with two opposite models :
    <br>-When a blue symbol appears, quickly tap the corresponding symbol to WIN against it. e.g When a blue Rock appears, you will respond with Paper to beat the Rock.
    <br>-When a red symbol appears, things are reversed, you need to choose another symbol to LOSE to it. e.g. When a blue Rock appears, instead of taping a Paper, you must respond by Scissors to lose to the Rock.
    <br><br>This funny game will incredibly reactivate and entertain your brain.
    <br>Have fun with Reverse Rock Paper Scissors</p>
